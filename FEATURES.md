## Supported audio formats



`.wav` `.flac` `.mp3` `.ogg` `.opus` `.m4a` `.m4b` `.mp4` `.aac` `.wv` `.wvc` `.ape` `.dsf` `.dff` `.aif` `.aiff` `.aifc` `.caf`

**CUE sheets** split a single ripped disc into up to 99 tracks, taking the format from the file the sheet points at. WAVs carrying their own RIFF markers work the same way.

**WAV and AIFF tags** are read from the ID3 chunk taggers add to them, so titles in any script and the cover come through; a WAV's own INFO list fills in whatever that leaves empty.

## Audio

- **Volume** - The same volume curve as the stock player is used.
- **Remember Volume** Four levels remembered separately, one per output: 3.5 mm, 4.4 mm, USB-C, Bluetooth.
- **Graphic EQ** - 10 bands at 31 Hz to 16 kHz, ±12 dB. Ten built-in presets and
  as many of your own as you like.
- **Parametric EQ** - 10 bands, each with frequency 20 Hz to 20 kHz, gain
  ±15 dB in tenths, Q from 0.10 to 10.00, and five shapes: peak, low shelf,
  high shelf, low-pass, high-pass. Preamp −15 to +6 dB. The page draws the real
  response, computed from the coefficients that are running. Presets are
  Equalizer APO files in the `PEQ` folder of the card: the `ParametricEQ.txt`
  that AutoEq publishes for your headphones loads as it is, and a preset saved
  on the player opens in APO.
- **MSEB** - HiBy's MageSound tuning, matched to the stock player: 10
  characteristics driven by 13 filters, with the slider travel selectable
  between 20, 40 and 100.
- **Soundfield** - mid/side width from mono to twice natural.
- **Channel balance** - ±20 dB in half-decibel steps.
- **Crossfeed** - level, cutoff and delay, all adjustable.
- **ReplayGain** - off, track or album, read from the tags.
- **Fade** - one to twelve seconds at the track boundary.
- **Gapless** - the PCM device stays open between tracks of the same shape.
- **DSD** - DoP by default, with nothing in the chain allowed to touch the
  samples; or converted here to 176.4 kHz PCM. DoP falls back to conversion by
  itself when the device refuses the rate.
- **DAC controls** - four digital filters, DRE, NOS, high gain, and DSD gain
  compensation from 0 to 6 dB.
- **Line out** - drives the jack at a fixed level for an amplifier, refuses
  volume changes while on, and puts your level back on the way out.
- **USB DAC** - the player becomes a USB sound card, 32 kHz to 384 kHz.
- **USB audio out** - a DAC or USB-C headphones driven with the player as host.
- **In-line remote** - the three-button cable remote: one click play/pause, two
  next, three previous.

## Library

- **Sorting across alphabets** - a collation that groups by script, folds case and accents, and skips leading articles unless you turn that off.
- **A–Z strip** - shown when scrolling a list.
- **Search** across tracks, albums and artists.
- **Albums with the same name stay apart** - an album is its name and whose it is: the album artist, the artist when there is none, and the folder when there is neither.
- **Quality badges** under a title: lossy, CD, Hi-Fi, DSD.
- **Playlists** - create, rename, reorder, delete. A long press on a row of All tracks, Albums, Artists or Album artists starts a selection, and the chosen tracks, albums or artists go into the queue, the favourites or a playlist together. Inside a playlist or the favourites the selection also takes the chosen tracks out, after asking. In the file browser the same works on tracks and folders, a folder bringing everything under it. A backup writes an extended M3U to the card that other players can read; import reads one back, resolves missing entries by file name, and reports what it found.
- **Playback modes** - normal, repeat all, repeat one, shuffle, and a continuous shuffle that deals a fresh order each round.
- **Album and folder chaining** - the next album starts when one ends, or the next folder in a depth-first walk when you came in through the browser.
- **The queue survives a reboot**, with positions, and so does the volume.

## Now playing

- Artwork edge to edge across the top, and the same picture flipped, blurred and dimmed behind the controls.
- **Alternative layout** - the progress bar becomes a **waveform**
- **Cover Flow** - an album carousel, swiped up from the bottom of the Music page.
- **Queue**, **Details** and, while an audiobook is loaded, **Chapters**.

## Streaming

- **Tidal** - sign in with the code on screen or with the QR-Code; Low, High, CD and Hi-res quality. Search, albums, artists, playlists, favourites and the featured lists. Favourites and playlists can be managed from the player.
- **Qobuz** - sign in with the account; MP3 320, FLAC 16/44.1, 24/96 and 24/192. Search, albums, artists, playlists, favourites and the featured lists. Favourites and playlists can be managed from the player.
- **Podcasts** - the Podcast Index catalogue: search, trending, follow up to 100
shows kept on the device.
- **Radio** - the radio-browser.info directory by language, country or genre,
plus search, favourites, recently played, and **My stations** read from a
`radio.txt` you write yourself in the card root. MP3 and AAC, HTTPS with real
certificate checking, and HLS.


## Wireless

- **Bluetooth out** - the whole stack is brought up by the player rather than by
  the firmware's scripts. Pair, connect, forget; the codec list comes from what
  the connected device announces and the best is chosen at each connection.
- **AirPods** - battery per earbud and for the case, model detection, and noise
  control: off, cancellation, transparency, adaptive.
- **Bluetooth in** - a phone or laptop connects and the player becomes its
  speaker, decoding through its own DAC. The incoming codec, rate and depth are
  shown.
- **AirPlay** - the player appears as an AirPlay target.
- **DLNA** - the player appears as a renderer.
- **Wi-Fi transfer** - a browser on the same network gets the card: upload
  files and whole folders, rename, move, delete, download, show hidden files.
  Reachable at `sonix-transfer.local`.
- **SonixLink** - a control protocol for a phone: the phone fetches the index
  once and queries it locally instead of paging over the wire. Playback state,
  queue, favourites, artwork and commands.
- **USB mass storage** - connect the device to a PC or a Smartphone to manage the files on the SD Card.

## Audiobooks

> Audiobooks go in the `Audiobooks` folder, in any subfolder: `Audiobooks/Author/Series/...` is read as the author and the series when the tags do not say.

- **Library, Series, Authors and Continue** - four sections, each sorted A-Z, Z-A or by date; the library also by recently listened, a series by the number of each book in it. Continue holds the books started and not finished, last listened first; the finished ones are behind the button beside the options.
- **A book is a file or a folder** - an `.m4b`, an `.mp3`, `.opus`, `.ogg` or `.flac` with chapters, or a single audio file is a book; audio files of one folder with the same album tag are one book whose files are its chapters, `CD 1` / `Disc 2` subfolders included, so several books side by side in a folder stay apart.
- **Author and series from the tags** - album artist or artist, `SERIES` / `SERIES-PART` and the movement name and number, in MP4, ID3v2 and Vorbis tags.
- The position is remembered per book, and survives a rescan.
- Chapters from the MP4 container, from ID3 frames, or from the `CHAPTERxxx` comments of Opus, Ogg Vorbis and FLAC.
- The two transport buttons are set independently to 10, 30 or 60 seconds.
- Speed 0.5x to 2.0x with the pitch preserved.
- Stop at the end of a chapter, and rewind a few seconds after a pause.
- **Sleep timer** - set a timer with the desired duration and the playback is paused automatically after it elapses.

## EPUB reader

> `.epub` files need to be inside the `Ebook` folder.

- Support for EPUB 2 and 3.
- Headings, emphasis, lists, quotes, rules, images, alignment and the table of
  contents.
- Text size from 14 to 50, line spacing, word spacing, margins, three reading themes (Paper,
  Sepia, Night) and three page-turn animations.
- **Bookmarks** - double-tap the top of a page; up to 64 per book.
- A **reading bar** along the bottom with chapter, page, progress, battery and
  clock, each one optional.

## Game Boy

> The `.gb` and `.gbc` ROMs need to be inside the `Games` folder, each in a separate folder: `GB` for Game Boy and `GBC` for Game Boy Color.
> The boot ROMS need to be inside the `Games/Bios` folder, dmg_boot.bin for Game Boy cgb_boot.bin for Game Boy Color. (This step is optional).

- Games show their real cartridge names, matched by CRC32 against the libretro
  databases.
- Save states, battery RAM, five palettes, shaders and GBC color
  correction.

  Polski, Português BR, Čeština, Russian, Chinese, Japanese. Titles and tags in
  Korean, Thai and Arabic are shown too, Arabic right to left.

  assignable to nothing, play/pause, previous, next, volume up or volume down.
- **Keyboard layout** - ten layouts: English, Italian, German, Spanish, French,
  Dutch, Polish, Brazilian Portuguese, Czech and Russian.

  update from a `.upt` on the card, and factory reset.
- **Developer options** - unlocked by tapping the build number: ADB, log to the
  card, database log, disabling the software volume attenuation, and a page of
  running processes and memory.
