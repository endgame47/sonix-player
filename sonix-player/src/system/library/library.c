// is exactly what happened to AAC and ALAC, both inside a .m4a.
//
// .m4b is excluded: it is an audiobook and has its own scanner in
// audiobookdb.c, feeding the Audiobooks page. Indexing it here too would put
// ten hours of novel in among the tracks.
//
// .mp4 is excluded as well. The decoder can read it -- same container as a
// .m4a -- but a file named .mp4 is a film, and the exceptions are not worth the
// certainty of finding an episode among the albums. Music in this container is

// What a file actually is
//
// The quality badge in the lists needs three things about a track: whether it
// is DSD, whether it is lossy, and -- for the lossless ones -- whether it is CD
// or better than CD. The first two are the container; the third is the sample
// rate and the bit depth, which nothing was writing down.
//
// Opening a decoder to ask costs an order of magnitude more per file than
// reading the tags, which is minutes on a large library for two integers. So
// the header is read directly instead -- a few bytes at a known place -- and
// only for the containers where the answer is not already settled by the
// extension:
//
//   FLAC  STREAMINFO, the first metadata block, at a fixed offset
//   WAV   the `fmt ` chunk, found by walking the chunk list
//   DSF   the `fmt ` chunk of a DSD stream, at a fixed offset
//   MP4   through the parser the player already has (rate, and ALAC's depth)
//   APE   the Monkey's Audio header, through apedec_probe()
//
// Anything else keeps zeros, and a row with zeros gets no badge: a wrong badge
// is worse than none. That is mp3, ogg, opus, raw aac -- all lossy, so the
// badge is decided by the container anyway -- and WavPack, which is the one
// lossless format left without an answer.

// delete a track from the card: files go missing when the card is taken to a

// match, or when it was checked against an earlier mount than the one in the
// reader now.

// with ten. The transaction stays: one commit for the lot, because a commit
// each would be one card write each.
//
// The lock is taken per row and given back between them, not held for the
// length of the write. That is not tidiness: what a caller does between two
// rows is work out what the next one says, and working that out means asking
// the index for a track's name -- which takes this same lock, which is not
// recursive. Held across the write, the first such question would be a deadlock.
// The scan works the same way for the same reason.
//
// A transaction that will not start -- a scan has one open, and this connection
// allows one at a time -- is not a failure: the rows go in one at a time
// instead, which is slower and just as correct.
