# build: it carries the .symver lines that keep five maths functions on the
# names the device's glibc 2.22 knows, and a .symver applies only to its own
# unit. Target only.
#
# -march=mips32r2: the toolchain is configured without --with-arch, and for the
# o32 ABI GCC then defaults to MIPS I. The X1600's core runs MIPS32r2 (the
# device's kernel modules and bluealsa are built for it), which gives mul, madd,
# conditional moves and no load delay slots.
#
# -mno-madd4: no madd.s/msub.s. Every float multiply and add stays a separate,
# separately rounded instruction, as in a MIPS I build.
#
# -mplt: the player is an executable at a fixed address, so its code need not
# be position-independent. Without this GCC compiles it as if it were a shared
# library: every function that calls another sets up $gp, every call loads its
# target from the GOT and jumps through a register, $gp is reloaded after each
# call, and every global is two loads. With it a call is a plain jal and a
# global is lui+lw; calls into the shared libraries go through a PLT the linker
# builds, and their data (stdout, stderr) is copied into the executable. The
# arithmetic is untouched: only how code and data are reached. Needs a dynamic
# linker with MIPS PLT support, which glibc has had since 2.9 (the device has
# 2.22). Ignored for anything built with -fPIC.
#
# -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections: every function and every object in a
# section of its own, so that --gc-sections (TARGET_LDFLAGS) can leave out the
# ones nothing calls -- the LVGL widgets the interface never creates, the parts
# of SQLite it never asks for. The player locks its code into RAM at startup
# (lock_code_pages in main.c), so code that is never run is memory that is
# never given back. What stays is compiled exactly as before.

# cache, smaller code is seldom slower code.
